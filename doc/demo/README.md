# Demo

In this folder you will find a demonstration of the application
with 2000 sample log lines and some Overwatch data. The data is 
from late 2021 and 2022 so you may need to adjust the viewing date 
to see anything.

## Run

1. Run ``./run.sh`` from this directory
2. The database will take some time to initialize so be patient
3. Enter admin password when prompted
4. The application should be reachable here: [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
5. Shutdown the application with `./stop.sh`
